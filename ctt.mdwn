## Introduction

Ever wondered how much you work compared to what you should?
Are you in the need to record working time for a customer?
Do you want something that is very simple, geek compatible
and runs on the command line? Then you may have found the right
software.

## Installation

Get ctt from git ([gitweb](http://git.schottelius.org/?p=ctt;a=summary)):

    git clone git://git.schottelius.org/ctt

The code is mirrored on [github](https://github.com/telmich/ctt) and
can be accessed via

    git clone git://github.com/telmich/ctt.git

## Examples

    # Track some time
    % ctt track test
    Comment: Did some cool work
    
    # Track for a given time range
    % ctt track --sd 2013-04-29-1000 --ed 2013-05-29-1200 test
    Comment: Long working period
    
    # Track (keep running), but specify different start date
    % ctt track --sd 2013-04-29-0800  test
    Comment: Started early today
    
    # Track without prompting for a comment
    % ctt track -n test                                       
    
    # List available projects
    % ctt listprojects
    [...]
    
    # List all entries of this month for project test

    [...]
    
    # List all entries from January
    % ctt report --sd 2013-01-01 --ed 2013-01-31 test 
    
    # List all entries from January matching either rails ruby or cdist
    % ctt report --sd 2013-01-29 --ed 2013-04-29 -e "(rails|ruby|cdist)" test
